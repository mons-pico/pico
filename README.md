# C Pico library
The Pico encoding is intended for packaging malicious software to prevent it
from running, and also to protect it from detection and damage due to
anti-malware software.  The format is simple and (unlike compression) provides
quick direct access to the unencrypted bytes.

Read about the format [here][mons-pico].

This library provides a C API for Pico encoding and decoding files, and for
working with those files.  At present everything is implemented, except for
hashing.

More information can be found [in the docs folder](docs/).
